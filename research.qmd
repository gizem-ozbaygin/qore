## Research Overview

The research of the Quantum Optimization Research Group focuses on the development of advanced optimization algorithms for computationally challenging decision-making problems. Our work is motivated by the growing need for scalable and reliable solution methods for problem classes that arise in engineering design, control, finance, and large-scale systems optimization.

A central theme of our research is the investigation of **hybrid quantum–classical computational frameworks**, where emerging quantum resources are integrated into well-established classical optimization methods in a principled and theoretically grounded manner.

## Core Problem Class: Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programming

A major focus of the group is **Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programming (MISDP)**. MISDP problems combine:

- Discrete decision variables  
- Continuous semidefinite constraints  
- Nonlinear and nonconvex feasible regions  

These problems are known to be **NP-hard** and represent a significant computational bottleneck for existing optimization solvers. Despite their difficulty, MISDP models naturally arise in many real-world applications, including robust control, portfolio optimization, structural design, and systems engineering.

Our research aims to develop algorithmic frameworks that address the intrinsic complexity of MISDP while preserving solution quality and theoretical guarantees.

## Methodological Framework

The group adopts a decomposition-based approach to tackle MISDP problems. Our methodological toolbox includes:

- Semidefinite programming relaxations  
- Cutting-plane and outer-approximation methods  
- Branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut frameworks  
- Problem-specific reformulations and relaxations  

These techniques allow large and complex optimization problems to be decomposed into more tractable subproblems, enabling systematic exploration of the solution space.

## Quantum–Classical Integration

A distinctive aspect of our research is the **integration of quantum computational subroutines into classical optimization frameworks**. Rather than replacing classical solvers, we investigate how quantum algorithms can be used to accelerate or enhance specific computational components, such as:

- Solving structured subproblems  
- Improving relaxation quality  
- Enhancing branching or cut-generation strategies  

This hybrid perspective ensures that quantum resources are used where they are most effective, while classical optimization methods provide robustness, scalability, and interpretability.

## Expected Contributions

Our research contributes to both theory and practice by:

- Developing novel hybrid quantum–classical optimization algorithms  
- Advancing the algorithmic understanding of MISDP  
- Providing rigorous computational benchmarks and performance analyses  
- Establishing principled guidelines for integrating quantum methods into classical solvers  

Through these contributions, the group aims to bridge the gap between emerging quantum technologies and practical large-scale optimization.
