## About the Group

The Quantum Optimization Research Group is based in the **Department of Industrial Engineering at Bilkent University**. The group conducts research at the intersection of optimization theory, computational methods, and emerging quantum technologies.

Our work is driven by fundamental questions in mathematical optimization and decision science, with a particular emphasis on developing algorithmic frameworks that are both theoretically sound and computationally effective.

## Mission

The mission of the group is to advance the state of the art in optimization by:

- Developing rigorous and scalable optimization algorithms  
- Bridging classical optimization methods with emerging quantum computational paradigms  
- Training students in mathematically grounded, algorithm-oriented research  
- Contributing to open, reproducible, and high-impact scientific research  

We aim to produce research that is relevant both to the academic community and to real-world decision-making problems.

## Research Philosophy

The group follows a **methodology-driven research philosophy**. Rather than treating quantum computing as a standalone solution, we investigate how quantum resources can be meaningfully integrated into classical optimization frameworks.

Our research emphasizes:
- Mathematical rigor and theoretical guarantees  
- Careful algorithm design and decomposition  
- Transparent computational benchmarking  
- Practical relevance and scalability  

This philosophy ensures that proposed methods are robust, interpretable, and suitable for real-world applications.

## Collaboration and Environment

The Quantum Optimization Research Group maintains an open and collaborative research environment. We actively collaborate with researchers from different disciplines, including:

- Industrial Engineering  
- Mathematics  
- Computer Science  
- Systems and Control Engineering  

The group also participates in national and international research projects and welcomes collaboration with academic and industrial partners.
