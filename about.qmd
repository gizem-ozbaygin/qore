## About QORE

**QORE** (Quantum Operations Research) is a research lab founded at **Bilkent University**. Our lab is home to a global team of researchers who are experts in various scientific fields. By combining our knowledge from across the world, we are able to approach optimization and quantum technology from new and innovative perspectives.  We work at the intersection of optimization theory, computational methods, and emerging quantum technologies.

## Mission

**QORE** aims to advance the field of optimization by:

* **Building fast and reliable algorithms** to solve complex problems
* **Bridging classical optimization methods** with emerging quantum computational paradigms
* **Training students** in mathematically grounded, algorithm-oriented research
* **Scientifically contributing** to open, reproducible, and high-impact research

We aim to conduct research that is valuable to both the academic community and for solving real-world problems.

## How We Work

At **QORE**, we do not treat quantum computing as a stand-alone solution. Instead, we study how quantum tools can be integrated into existing mathematical frameworks to solve problems more effectively.

In our research, we prioritize:
* **Mathematical rigor** and clear theoretical foundations.
* **Smart algorithm design** and decomposition.
* **Computational benchmarking** to measure how well our methods perform and scale.
