    "text": "Core Problem Class: Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programming\nA major focus of the group is Mixed-Integer Semidefinite Programming (MISDP). MISDP problems combine:\n\nDiscrete decision variables\n\nContinuous semidefinite constraints\n\nNonlinear and nonconvex feasible regions\n\nThese problems are known to be NP-hard and represent a significant computational bottleneck for existing optimization solvers. Despite their difficulty, MISDP models naturally arise in many real-world applications, including robust control, portfolio optimization, structural design, and systems engineering.\nOur research aims to develop algorithmic frameworks that address the intrinsic complexity of MISDP while preserving solution quality and theoretical guarantees."
