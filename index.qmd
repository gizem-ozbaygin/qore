  The Quantum Optimization Research Group is based in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Bilkent University. The group conducts research on quantum optimization, computational methods, and mathematical modeling.


## Overview

The Quantum Optimization Research Group focuses on the development of **hybrid quantum classical optimization algorithms** for challenging problems arising in mathematical optimization and decision science. Our work lies at the intersection of **quantum computing**, **optimization theory**, and **computational methods**.

## Research Focus

Our primary research direction is the design and analysis of algorithms for **Mixed Integer Semidefinite Programming** and related problem classes. These problems are computationally demanding and arise in a wide range of applications, including control, finance, and engineering design.

We investigate how **quantum resources**, when integrated with classical optimization frameworks, can improve performance in terms of solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency.

## Methodological Approach

Our research emphasizes:
- Hybrid quantum classical algorithm design  
- Semidefinite programming and cutting-plane methods  
- Branch and bound frameworks for mixed-integer problems  
- Computational benchmarking and performance evaluation  

## Keywords

*Hybrid quantum classical optimization, MISDP, semidefinite programming, branch and bound, quantum algorithms*
